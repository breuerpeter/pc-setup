# Create PX4 pull request

Do the following, and don't output anything unless the step specifies it:

1. Read the PX4 pull request template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Let me know if you can't find it (in that case I am probably using Claude Code outside PX4 root dir)
3. Check the changes (commits) I made on the current branch
4. Formulate a pull request that strictly follows the PX4 pull request template (use the commit messages and code changes themselves to figure out how to fill in the sections of the template). Do not fill out the testing section (put "todo").
5. Use the Github MCP server to create the actual pull request. The repo is "Auterion/PX4_firmware_private_Freefly" and the target branch is $ARGUMENTS. The GitHub user is "pbreuer-ff".
